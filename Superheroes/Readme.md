# Visualization Superheros dataset

## Context:

Super Heroes have been in popular culture for a long time and now more than ever. Since its creation, super heroes have not been very diverse, but that is changing rapidly. This dataset aims to provide an overview about heroes and their physical as well as power characteristics, helping researchers and curious minds identify trends and patterns.

## Content:

This data was collected in June/2017 from superherodb and not updated since, so it may not be up to date. There are two datasets here. The first one lists the characteristics of every super hero found on my source, the second contains information about every superpower and lists if they are present in any given hero.
